# Banner Grabbing

- Banner grabbing is an information gathering technique used by penetration testers to enumerate information regarding the target operating system as well as the services that are running on its open ports
- The primary objective of banner grabbing is to identify the service running on a specific port as well as the service version
- Banner grabbing can be performed through various techniques:
	- Performing a service version detection scan with Nmap
	- Connecting to the open port with Netcat
	- Authenticating with the service (If the service supports authentication), for example; SSH, FTP, Telnet etc.

### DEMO

```shell
nmap -sV -O # Service Version, OS
nmap --script=banner # Banner grabbing

nc <ip> <port> # Banner grabbing

# If support authentication, you can also retrive banner by authenticating
# No credentials needed
ssh <user>@<ip>
```


# Vulnerability Scanning with Nmap Scripts

- https://nmap.org/book/nse.html

### DEMO

```shell
ls -la usr/share/nmap/scripts
nmap --script=<script>
namp --script=<script> --script-args=<args>

ls -la usr/share/nmap/scripts | grep <service> # Filter by service 
ls -la usr/share/nmap/scripts | grep vuln # Check the vulns

# Do reasearch how to use a specific script with script args
```


# Vulnerability Scanning with Metasploit

### DEMO

```shell
searchsploit <name>
msf6: search <name>
```
