# 42 Fixing Exploits

### DEMO

```shell
# Search for vulnerability, then download the exploit
searchsploit -m <exploit-id> # Download exploit in current directory
nano <exploit> # Watch the exploit code and info 
# You may need to change something in the code, like ip address or port 

# Extra...
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80
nc -nvlp <port> # Setup a listener
```


# Cross-Compiling Exploits

- In certain cases, exploit code will be developed in C/C++/C#, as a result, you will need to compile the exploit code in to a PE (Portable Executable) or binary
- Cross-Compiling is the process of compiling code for a platform other than the one performing the compilation
- As a penetration tester, you will need to have the skills necessary to compile exploit code developed in C

### NOTES

- **Mingw-w64**
	- Development environment to create Microsoft Windows PE applications
- **GCC**
	- GNU Compiler Collection
- https://gitlab.com/exploit-database/exploitdb-bin-sploits
	- Pre-compiled binary

### DEMO

- Download the exploit
	- `searchsploit -m <exploit-id>`
- Compiling 64bit an exploit written in C
	- `i686-w64-mingw32-gcc <exploit> -o <output-name>` 
- Compiling 32bit an exploit written in C
	- `i686-w64-mingw32-gcc <exploit> -o <output-name> -lws2_32`
