# 39 Introduction to Exploitation

- Exploitation consists of techniques and tools used by adversaries/penetration testers to gain an initial foothold on a target system or network
- Successful exploitation will heavily depend on the nature and quality of information gathering and service enumeration performed on the target
	- *We can only exploit a target if we know what is vulnerable - Unknown*
- So far, we have covered exploitation of Windows & Linux systems both manually and automatically, however, we still need to get a clearer picture of the exploitation methodology and the tools and techniques involved in the process

## Penetration Testing Execution Standard

- The Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES) is a penetration testing methodology that was developed by a team of information security practitioners with the aim of addressing the need for a comprehensive and up-to-date standard for penetration testing
- www.pentest-standard.org

## Penetration Testing Phases

1. Information Gathering
2. Enumeration
3. Exploitation
4. Post Exploitation
	- Privilege Escalation
	- Maintaining Persistent Access
	- Clearing Tracks

### Exploitation Methodology

- Identify Vulnerable Services
- Identify & Prepare Exploit Code
- Gaining Access
	- Automated - MSF
	- Manual
- Obtain remote access on target system
- Bypass AV detection
- Pivot on to other systems
