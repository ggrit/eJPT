# 44 Exploitation Frameworks

# The Metasploit Framework (MSF)

- The Metasploit Framework (MSF) is an open-source, robust penetration testing and exploitation framework that is used by penetration testers and security researchers worldwide
- It provides penetration testers with a robust infrastructure required to automate every stage of the penetration testing life cycle
- It is also used to develop and test exploits and has one of the world's largest database of public, tested exploits
- The Metasploit Framework is designed to be modular, allowing for new functionality to be implemented with ease

# PowerShell-Empire

- PowerShell-Empire (AKA Empire) is a pure PowerShell exploitation/post-exploitation framework built on cryptological-secure communications and flexible architecture
- Empire implements the ability to run PowerShell agents without needing powershell.exe, rapidly deployable post-exploitation modules ranging from keyloggers to Mimikatz, and adaptable communications to evade network detection, all wrapped up in a usability-focused framework
- PowerShell Empire recently received an update and is now officially support and maintained by Kali Linux, more information regarding the update can be found here: www.kali.org/blog/empire-starkiller 

## Starkiller

- In addition to being updated and modernized, BC Security, the company responsible for maintaining the Empire has also developed a companion to Empire called Starkiller
- Starkiller is a GUI Frontend for the Powershell Empire. It is a Electron application written in VueJS and provides users with an intuitive way of interacting with Empire
- In order to get an understanding for how Empire works and the components that make up the framework, I would recommend going through the official documentation which can be found here: 
	- https://github.com/EmpireProject/Empire/wiki/Quickstart
- PowerShell-Empire & Starkiller are both available as packages in the Kali Linux repositories

sudo powershell-empire server # Start the backend
