# Searching for Publicly Available Exploits

- After identifying a potential vulnerability within a target or a service running on a target, the next logical step will involve searching for exploit code that can be used to exploit the vulnerability
- Exploit code can easily be found online, however, it is important to note that downloading and running exploit code against a target can be quite dangerous. It is therefore recommended to analyze the exploit code closely to ensure that it works as intended
- There are a handful of legitimate and vetted exploit databases that you should use when searching for exploits online:
	- Exploit-db
	- Rapid7

# Searching for Exploits with SearchSploit 

- In certain cases, you may not have access to online exploits and as a result, you must be able to use the exploit resources available locally/offline
- The entire Exploit-db database of exploits comes pre-packaged with Kali Linux, consequently providing you with all exploits locally
- The exploit-db offline databases of exploits can be accessed and queried with a tool called SearchSploit

### NOTES

```shell
/usr/share/exploitdb
sudo cp /usr/share/exploitdb/exploits/<path> # Manual copy of exploit in local directory

searchsploit
searchsploit -u # Package updates
searchsploit -m <exploit-id> # Download exploit in current directory
searchsploit -c # Case sensitive 
searchsploit -t # Search in title of the exploits
searchsploit -e "<text>" # Exact and order match on exploit title
searchsploit <type> <platform> <name> <port> <tag> | grep -e "<text>" # Example
searchsploit -w # Instead of local path get exploit-db links
```
